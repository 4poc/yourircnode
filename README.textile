YourIRCNode is a web based IRC client written in javascript using node.js,
socket.io and other technologies. Its currently under heavy development
and not yet usable. When its finished it is intended to be used for a
small number clients that can use it for multiple IRC networks, the
server is keeping the connections persistent the same way a bouncer(bnc)
or a server screen session would.

This project has been started during the first HackOnDay (http://hackonday.com)
a Hackathon of individuals that livestream their desktops during the
event.


Currently the following technology/frameworks/libraries are used:
- JavaScript (v8)
- Node.js
- Socket.io
- jQuery + jQuery UI
- Dust Template Engine
- Keylock (client side keybindings)
